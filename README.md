# # IBM Model 60/80 Bezel 72X8560
This is a recreation of the bezel for the 5.25inch slots for the IBM Model 60 and Model 80.
I believe it's the IBM FRU # 72X8560.

I have provided both an original recreation and also a reinforced one since the tabs are a little to brittle when printed with a FDM-printer.
